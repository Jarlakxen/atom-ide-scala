Scala language support for [Atom IDE], powered by [Scalameta language server].

----

### ðŸš§ WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš§

This project is in very early stage and is not ready for daily usage yet. Nevertheless you are welcome to try it out and provide any feedback either in the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/laughedelic/atom-ide-scala) or [Github issues](https://github.com/laughedelic/atom-ide-scala/issues).

----

This Atom plugin is written in [Scala.js] and is actively evolving, so if you are a Scala developer looking for a better development experience in Atom, you're encouraged to contribute. Check the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [open issues](https://github.com/laughedelic/atom-ide-scala/issues) especially the ones marked with `help wanted` label.

This plugin naturally doesn't do much, it just launches the server and wires communication with it to the Atom IDE UI services. All the interesting stuff is happening on the server side, so check also the server repository: [scalameta/language-server](https://github.com/scalameta/language-server).

## Features

Here is a list of the features which are implemented. It doesn't mean that they work well, just that they are implemented on the server side and supported by this plugin.

* [Formatting](https://github.com/facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui/blob/master/docs/code-format.md) with [Scalafmt](http://scalameta.org/scalafmt):
  + Add [Scalafmt config](http://scalameta.org/scalafmt/#Configuration) to the project
  + Use <kbd>cmd</kbd><kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>C</kbd> hotkey
  + It formats the whole file
* [Definitions](https://github.com/facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui/blob/master/docs/definitions.md):
  + It works only on the sources inside the project
  + Hold <kbd>cmd</kbd> and hover to preview the definition
  + Hold <kbd>cmd</kbd> and click to jump to the definition
* [Datatips](https://github.com/facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui/blob/master/docs/datatips.md) (type on hover):
  + Just hover over a symbol to see its type
  + You can also hold <kbd>alt</kbd> to see the type of symbol under the cursor
* [Outline view](https://github.com/facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui/blob/master/docs/outline-view.md) (symbols list):
  + Use <kbd>alt</kbd><kbd>O</kbd> to open it
* Auto completions as you type with presentation compiler
  + This requires running `*:scalametaEnableCompletions` in sbt first

See also default [Atom IDE keybindings](https://github.com/facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui/blob/master/docs/keybindings.md).

For the full list of implemented and planned features see the [server roadmap](https://github.com/scalameta/language-server/blob/master/README.md#roadmap).


## Usage

Note in the current state if you just install the plugin with the Atom package manager it won't do anything by itself. You need to setup the server. So check the [development setup](CONTRIBUTING.md#development) instructions.
